    "\n",
    "# 1. Intrusion Attempts: Forecasted vs Actual Values\n",
    "    ![Intrusion Attempts Forecast](./figures/Intrusion_Attempts_forecast_plot.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Trend Analysis: The data reveals a clear upward trend in intrusion attempts over time, indicating a steady increase in malicious activities targeting the system.\n",
    "    - Seasonality: There is evidence of recurring patterns, with peaks and troughs occurring at regular intervals. This cyclical behavior suggests periodic threats or exploitation of recurring vulnerabilities.\n",
    "    - Forecast Accuracy: The forecasted values (pink line) closely align with the actual values (blue line), demonstrating the reliability of the forecasting model used. The forecast projects a continued rise in intrusion attempts.\n",
    "## Recommendations:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Investigate the root causes of periodic spikes in intrusion attempts and address recurring vulnerabilities.\n",
    "    2. Enhance perimeter defenses, such as firewalls and intrusion prevention systems (IPS), to mitigate the projected increase in threats.\n",
    "    3. Use the forecast data to proactively allocate resources and improve incident response readiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Incident Detection Rate: Anomalies on Actual Values\n",
    "    ![Intrusion Attempts Forecast](./figures/Incident_Detection_Rate_anomalies_plot.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Anomalies Identified: The model detected multiple anomalies (red circles), representing instances where the detection rate significantly deviated from expected behavior. These could indicate system misconfigurations, unusual attack patterns, or delayed responses.\n",
    "    - Overall Stability: The detection rate generally remains within the expected range (purple shaded region), indicating consistent performance of the detection mechanisms. However, periodic spikes and dips highlight areas for further investigation.\n",
    "    - Spike Analysis: Spikes in detection rates may correlate with periods of heightened activity or improved detection capabilities, while dips could reflect potential monitoring gaps or delayed responses.\n",
    "## Recommendations:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Investigate the root causes of anomalies to determine if they were triggered by system issues, attacker behavior, or external factors.\n",
    "    2. Strengthen detection mechanisms during anticipated periods of increased activity, as identified in the intrusion attempts forecast.\n",
    "    3. Conduct regular audits and testing of detection systems to ensure consistent and reliable performance.\n",
    "    4. Optimize thresholds and refine detection logic to minimize false positives and negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "# High-Level Insights:\n",
    "    1. Correlated Trends: The upward trend in intrusion attempts and the relatively stable detection rate suggest that the organization is successfully detecting threats despite the increasing attack volume.\n",
    "    2. Proactive Planning: The forecasted rise in intrusion attempts highlights the importance of scaling up security measures and optimizing response processes to handle the growing threat landscape.\n",
    "    3. Anomaly Management: Addressing the identified anomalies in the detection rate provides an opportunity to improve detection accuracy and maintain system resilience.\"\"\",\n",

Key metrics include Intrusion Attempts (unauthorized access attempts), Malicious Traffic Proportion (percentage of harmful network activity), Incident Detection Rate (percentage of threats identified), MTTD/MTTR (time to detect/respond to incidents), and Data Breach Volume (amount of compromised data). Other critical KPIs include Patch Compliance (rate of systems updated), False Positive/Negative Rates (accuracy of detection tools), User Awareness Metrics (training effectiveness, e.g., phishing test results), and Vulnerability Management (percentage of critical vulnerabilities remediated). Additional metrics cover Privileged Access Management, Endpoint Protection, Regulatory Compliance, and Cost of Incidents. Tracking these KPIs helps organizations mitigate risks, improve defenses, and ensure compliance.\n",
